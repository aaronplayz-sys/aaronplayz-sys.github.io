## The inspiration

Being part of a gaming community called "Frontier Biz" we wanted to put our Knowle together and make guides so it is easier on those struggling to reach higher difficulties in Titianfall 2.

## Initially making a website was thrown out the window

We thought when creating the guide just using discord would be sufficient. However, as time went on I started questioning if the server would to be deleted, Jackson (the founder of this community) were to disappear- would all of this effort be lost to time? Why is the only backup only accessible to Jackson on his Google Drive account. I did speak out about this openly and was assured it won't be lost to time.

## My issue using discord to house everything

Slowly as we completed one page at a time, we created a new discord channel...

And now it's an issue. Too many channels is the discord server, making it feel crowded.

Took almost 2 years in the making all of these guides filled with information with suggestions, aimed to aid both new players and veterans of titianfall 2. Though I was the [only editor], and the only one who saw it that way.

## Took matters into my own hands

Knowing how I made personal website all by myself, I said screw their opinions do it myself show it off to them when it is done.
