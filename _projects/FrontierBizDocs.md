## The inspiration

Being part of a gaming community called "Frontier Biz" we wanted to put our Knowle together and make guides so it is easier on those struggling to reach higher difficulties in Titianfall 2.

## Initially making a website was thrown out the window

We thought when creating the guide just using discord would be sufficient. However, as time went on I started questioning if the server would to be deleted, Jackson (the founder of this community) were to disappear- would all of this effort be lost to time? Why is the only backup only accessible to Jackson on his Google Drive account. I did speak out about this openly and was assured it won't be lost to time.

## My issue using discord to house everything

Slowly as we completed one page at a time, we created a new discord channel...

And now it's an issue. Too many channels is the discord server, making it feel crowded.

Took almost 2 years in the making all of these guides filled with information with suggestions, aimed to aid both new players and veterans of TitanFall 2. Though I was the [only editor], and the only one who saw it that way.

## Took matters into my own hands

Knowing how I made personal website all by myself, I said screw their opinions do it myself show it off to them when it is done.

## October 2025 Update

I have spoken to Jackson, it has been agreed together that a website is way better for both readability and preservation. Once all information regard to the guides are complete many discord channels will be archived any only visible to anyone with the author role.

It also turned out that others in our community (full disclosure I am considered as a co-owner) wanted an alternative way to read our work. Instead of this being a little rebel project, its completion is now a community milestone.

## December 2025 Update

All guides are written, some are pending to be rewritten and reviewed, mainly the map guides. Most guide channels in the Discord server have been moved to an archived category and will be deleted once guide creation is considered complete. Finally, the website is the offical way to read our guides.
