Graduated with my A.S. Computer Information Technology degree. Going after a BAS in Computing Technology and Software Development.

On December 10th 2024, I had met Valencia's graduation requirement and graduated. I was invited by the same college to transfer my credits into their Bachelor of Applied Science in Computing Technology and Software Development. Since this degree program has two concentrations, which are:

1. Cloud Computing
2. Software Development

I decided to go down the cloud computing route as this as I have more interest in this area compared to software development. I have updated the about page (aka the home page), the CV page, and the downloadable PDF that is on the CV page to reflect the change on this milestone.
